    <h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
    <p> Hi, my name is orange! I am super interested in FLOSS software, Linux, obsidian, and really all things tech.
        I&#39;m also really into Minecraft, I&#39;ve been playing for at least seven years. (mostly 1.8, although these
        days I play the latest version a lot more on SMPs.) I&#39;m always open to new ideas! Also, I don&#39;t bite,
        contact me if you want. </p>
    <p>I&#39;m also a minimalist, and while yes, I wear a gray t-shirt every day, it has <em>nothing</em> to do with my
        minimalism, it&#39;s just because I look best in a gray shirt. I am not a walking stereotypical gray-shirt
        wearing minimalist Asian minecraft sweat dude. Nope. Not me.</p>
    <p>I&#39;ve been admin/moderator/owner/co-owner on dozens of servers in discord or otherwise in the past, so if I am
        sending you this as an application of sorts, then I have tons of experience in that area.</p>
    <p>I know HTML and some basic CSS, but otherwise don&#39;t really have any coding skills. I just click things and
        make computers work where others can&#39;t I guess. I also have a lot of skills breaking things open.</p>
