    <p> Hi, you can call me orange. I speak English as my mother tongue and am learning Arabic. I love FLOSS software and am really interested in GNU/Linux. I don't currently know any programming languages (does HTML and CSS count? I don't think so.) But I am starting to learn js, after which I will get into more advanced stuff. I hope to major in compsci in university. </p>
    <p>I love playing Minecraft; I've been playing since 2017 and don't play anything else other than occasionally Asphalt 9 and Mario Kart with my brothers. I am fairly decent at 1.8 and 1.9+ pvp both, and my building skills aren't too bad - at least in my opinion.</p>
